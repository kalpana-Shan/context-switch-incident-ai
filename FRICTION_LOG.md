📝 FRICTION LOG - CONTEXT-SWITCH AI Incident Context Aggregator

🎯 The Problem: Incident Context Switching Hell

🔴 BEFORE CONTEXT-SWITCH: The 20-Minute Manual Nightmare

Scenario: API Error Rate Spike at 2:15 PM
2:15 PM - PagerDuty alert: "API Error Rate Spike to 25%"
2:16 PM - Engineer joins Zoom bridge, starts investigation
2:17 PM - "What's broken? Let me check all the systems..."

🕒 TIME: 0-2 MINUTES - Initial Alert Panic
❌ Frantic tab opening across 5+ different tools
❌ No single source of truth
❌ High stress, pressure to resolve quickly

2:18 PM - Open Datadog: Check error rates and latency
2:20 PM - Still loading dashboards, configuring time ranges
🕒 TIME: 2-5 MINUTES - Metrics Investigation
❌ Different query languages for each tool
❌ Dashboards load slowly under load
❌ Mental context switching begins

2:22 PM - Switch to New Relic: Check application performance
2:24 PM - Correlate with deployment timeline in GitHub
🕒 TIME: 5-9 MINUTES - Correlation Chaos
❌ Manual pattern matching across systems
❌ "Was there a deployment around this time?"
❌ GitHub commit messages unclear

2:26 PM - Search Slack: "Any team discussions about changes?"
2:28 PM - Scroll through multiple channels, DMs
🕒 TIME: 9-13 MINUTES - Communication Archaeology
❌ Buried messages across different channels
❌ No centralized incident communication
❌ Missing critical context from other teams

2:30 PM - Check Jira: Recent tickets, known issues
2:32 PM - Still no clear root cause, growing frustration
🕒 TIME: 13-17 MINUTES - Desperate Searching
❌ Information overload
❌ Analysis paralysis sets in
❌ Human error risk increases under stress

2:33 PM - "Maybe it's the database? Check CPU metrics..."
2:35 PM - Finally identify potential database connection issue
🕒 TIME: 17-20 MINUTES - Exhausted Resolution
❌ 20 minutes wasted gathering context
❌ Only 2 minutes spent on actual debugging
❌ Engineer mentally drained, prone to mistakes

TOTAL FRICTION COST: 20 MINUTES, HIGH STRESS, HUMAN ERROR RISK

🎭 Real Incident Friction Examples

Incident 1: Database Latency Spike

BEFORE FRICTION:
8min: Check database metrics, identify CPU at 95%
6min: Correlate with recent deployment timeline
4min: Search team communications about changes
2min: Manual pattern analysis

AFTER CONTEXT-SWITCH:
30sec: AI identifies "Deployment #392 modified query patterns causing full table scans"
IMMEDIATE: Focus on query optimization
RESULT: 19.5 minutes saved, precise root cause


Incident 2: API 5xx Errors

BEFORE FRICTION:
7min: Analyze error logs across services
5min: Trace service dependencies manually
4min: Check infrastructure health metrics

🔄 The Friction Loop We Broke

OLD FRICTION LOOP (Vicious Cycle)
ALERT → MANUAL_CONTEXT_GATHERING → STRESS → DELAY → HUMAN_ERROR → LONGER_DOWNTIME
↓ (20min wasted) ↓ (poor decisions) ↓ (costly mistakes)

NEW EFFICIENCY LOOP (Virtuous Cycle)
ALERT → AI_CONTEXT_AGGREGATION → FOCUSED_ACTION → RAPID_RESOLUTION → PREVENTION
↓ (30sec automated) ↓ (data-driven) ↓ (minimal downtime)
